# Forest's Quiz

Simple quiz application that stores user radio button selections to quiz questions, to output their score once quiz completes. The user has the ability to retake the quiz as many times as they'd like, with scores and previous selections being reset with each restart.

## Getting Started

All necessary library files  (Bootstrap JQuery) are specified within their respective folders. To run locally, simple download the repo to a local directory, user terminal to navigate to that directory and issue command >open index.html 

### Prerequisites

A CDN of the popper.js library is included at the bottom of the index.html body section, so internet access is necessary. However I currently haven't implemented any popper.js functionality. This is a future plan.

## Built With

* [Javascrip]
* [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
